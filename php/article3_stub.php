    A father who ignored his wife's pleas to get the Covid vaccine has died of the disease after spending three weeks in hospital.
<br>
    Gligor Kedioski died of Covid-19 aged 45 on January 2 after being admitted to hospital in December and placed in an induced coma.
    <br>
    Friends and family are not sure how he contracted the virus, but Gligor had not been vaccinated, despite his wife Bilyana's attempts to persuade him.
    <br>
    Now, they are battling to repatriate Gligor's body to his native country of Macedonia, in line with his wishes.
    <br>
    Born in Prilep, Gligor lived in Liverpool with Bilyana and their five-year-old daughter, working in a factory and as a delivery driver.
    <br>
    Paying tribute to the father-of-one, his friends described him as a generous man who was full of life and always talking about life's next adventure.</p>

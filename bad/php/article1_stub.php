    Millions of people are living in areas where Covid cases appear to be falling, MailOnline can reveal as evidence continues to mount that the worst of the pandemic may be over.
<br>
    Yesterday England logged a 29 per cent fall in positive tests compared to the week before, marking the biggest dip of its kind since late September. Infections are dropping in every region except the North East and London yesterday posted just 12,309 cases — its fewest in a month.
<br>
    More precise data show outbreaks were already shrinking in 95 of the country's 315 councils, with five of the ten areas recording the sharpest dips located in the capital.
<br>
    Experts are now hopeful that the UK's outbreak will follow a similar trajectory to South Africa's, which was the first country to fall victim to the extremely-transmissible variant. Its cases have almost completely fizzled out over the past month.

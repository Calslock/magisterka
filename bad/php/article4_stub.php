    Twin panda cubs have made a brief first public appearance at a zoo in Japan today - before it closes to visitors again amid a spike in Covid cases.
<br>
    Male cub Xiao Xiao and his sister Lei Lei were born at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo in June last year.
    <br>
    And this morning the pair took their first public steps and played together in front of hundreds of delighted fans.
    <br>
    In a video released by the zoo, the cubs sit back to back on a tree, playing with bamboo, while visitors can be heard saying 'kawaii (cute)!' in the background. Xiao Xiao then cheekily steps on his sister to move up the tree.

    Yahoo workers in Japan have been told that they can work from anywhere in the country rather than return to the office - and commute by plane when necessary.
<br>
    Around 8,000 employees will benefit from the change, which takes effect on April 1, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
    <br>
    More than 90 per cent of employees are already working remotely and Yahoo President Kentaro Kawabe said their performance has held or improved at home, Japan Times reported.
    <br>
    The new flexible working policy will also allow employees to commute by plane, an option which was not previously available to workers, a company statement explained.
